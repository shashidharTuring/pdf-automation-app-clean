You are a document annotator working on a Corporate Annual Report as part of the Document Understanding - Corporate Finance workflow.

Your goal is to challenge the model's reasoning capabilities. Please generate 5 model-breaking finance-related questions that:
- Are each at least 20 words long.
- Are grounded in a chart, table, or infographic in the provided pages.
- Require complex or multi-hop reasoning, aggregation, comparisons, indirect references, or financial logic that often confuses models.

For each of the 5 questions, return:
1. The long-form question (≥ 20 words).
2. A brief explanation of why this question is likely to challenge or break a model like GPT-4o.

Do not include answers or solutions.
Avoid use of names or PII.
Focus only on the question and why it’s difficult.
